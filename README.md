# topTenQuiz
It is a part of Udacity Google Reskilling India. I made this project as a part of it. It is a top ten quizzes application, in which I asked 10 question related to computer science. It have 4 quizzes which have only one right answer, using RadioButton. Then 4 quizzes which may have one or more right answer, using CheckBox. Then last two question is little hard, as user have to input answer in the given field. I made that by using EditText. Then in last we have submit button that will display the final score scored by the application user, and below submit button we have TextView, that will show the score on the sclae of 10.
